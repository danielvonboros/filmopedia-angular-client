### Application functions

The Filmopedia Application provides a collection of movies, that can be viewed by registered users. User data is also stored in a collection and API calls are made

### Setting up the tools:

First up, make sure you have Angular CLI installed globally. Angular CLI is the command line tool that is used to create the application, its components and make it accessible in your browser.

Do this by typing

```
$ npm install --global @angular/cli@latest
```

in your terminal

You can now download the repo to your computer, install the necessary modules by running:

```
$ npm install
```

Make sure there were no errors installing the necessary modules to your application.

### Start the application

Now start the development server by typing

```
$ ng serve
```

The console shows you the port on which the application is rendered. If your browser, doesn't open automatically, open it manually and navigate to the URL given in the terminal, in most cases: http://localhost:4200.
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Building additional components

To build a component, run

```
$ ng generate component <name of the component to create>
```

### Build the project

Type

```
$ ng build
```

in the console to build the project. The build files will be stored in the /dist directory.

### Unit Tests

To run unit-tests with [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io), type

```
$ ng test
```

into the console.

### End-to-end tests

End to end tests can be started by typing

```
$ run e2e
```

in the console.
